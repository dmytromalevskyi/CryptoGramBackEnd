# CryptoGram project.

I worked in a group of 6 to design a prototype of a cryptocurrency trading platform using React and Typescript that won the “Best Project Award” of the module. If you wish to run it make sure to install and run both the backend and the frontend.

The part developed here is the Backend.

To run this project simply go to the folder with the project in your terminal

Run the following commands:

# yarn install

# yarn dev

If asked whether to occupy a diffrent port, answer yes (Y)

To use the project run the GUI part of the project.
